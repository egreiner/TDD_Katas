Application Kata „Wordwrap“

Write an application that rearranges a text so that lines are wrapped at a given column width.

The user will enter the text into a textbox. 
Furthermore the user gives the number of characters per line. 
The example shows 25 characters as the new line length. 
Clicking the Wrap button wraps the text. 
The result is shown in the lower textbox.
